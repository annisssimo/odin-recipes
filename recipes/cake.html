    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This is my mother's traditional honey cake, made every year for the Jewish new year Rosh Hashanah. We eat honey cake in order to have a sweet new year. I love the glaze for this especially - the cake is a little dry. I could eat the glaze with a spoon! Best served with tea.</p>
